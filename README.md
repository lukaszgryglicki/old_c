# old_c
This is something from the grave, I've found it in an oldest FreeBSD 5 custom ISO I've build 21+ years ago, those are some of the oldest "programs" I've ever written (for fun).

# First RPG program 

The first RPG program that me & my team were using for year for playing our own system.

We used [this program](https://github.com/lukaszgryglicki/old_c/blob/master/grpg/SOURCE%20I/applicat.cpp) to create characters, then for adding experience for them after every RPG session.

When I now browse its sources, and other sources from my childhood I'm laughing how primitive it was.
