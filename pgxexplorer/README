	This is an initial release of PgXexplorer (ver. 0.28)
This program WILL be:
	- graphic (GTK) explorer for PostgreSQL databases
	- will support ADD/REMOVE/MODIFY tables and tables metadata
	- currently supporst ADD/REMOVE
	- will have Wizards for tables,views,triggers,queries etc.
	- will support DB backup to FILE and import from file
		(standard SQL file to use with psql -f FILE_IN.SQL
		and pg_dump > FILE_OUT.SQL)
	- will support query executing FROM file and from control in GTK
	- query results will be displayed in table (ReadOnly)
	- should support TRIGERS ADDING/REMOVING for tables
		(written in SQL and eventually C)
	- will support creating DataBases and removing it
	- displays tables metadata, types and entire data in table on demand
	- possible there will be design view with connections 
		(FOREIGN/PRIMARY KEYS) <rather not>
	- for initial plans, thats it, I/m open for propositions
		(of functionaliity and help with coding)
		(especially I want some documentation on GTK and CVS)
For installing see INSTALL file
	-file genpardta.c i asmqsort.s are needed to create parsers source files
		sqlparser.c & sqlparser.h, they are used only once, so we don't
		need to add them to project, if You want yto compile them yourself
		try make -f mkfile_parser, this will compile only on *BSD
		because qsort routine I'm using is written by me in Gnu-ASM
		it uses *BSD kernel calling convention, so F.E solaris may fail
		Linux & *BSD are known to work
extra/
	- contains example DB program, read docs in extra/ dir
		AMD64 is now supported
		first try v0.31
